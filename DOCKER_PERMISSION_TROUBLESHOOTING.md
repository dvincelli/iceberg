If you're in the `docker` group and still encountering a "permission denied" error when trying to stop a container, here are a few additional steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. **Restart Your Session**:
   - If you recently added yourself to the `docker` group, make sure you have logged out and back in, or restarted your terminal session, to apply the group membership changes.

2. **Verify Group Membership**:
   - Double-check that your user is indeed part of the `docker` group by running:
     ```bash
     groups $USER
     ```
   - Ensure that `docker` is listed among the groups.

3. **Check Docker Daemon Status**:
   - Ensure that the Docker daemon is running properly. You can check its status with:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl status docker
     ```
   - If it's not running, start it with:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl start docker
     ```

4. **Inspect Docker Socket Permissions**:
   - Verify the permissions on the Docker socket:
     ```bash
     ls -l /var/run/docker.sock
     ```
   - The socket should be owned by `root` and the group should be `docker`. If not, you might need to adjust the permissions.

5. **Check for SELinux or AppArmor**:
   - If you're using a system with SELinux or AppArmor, ensure that there are no security policies blocking Docker operations. You might need to adjust these settings or temporarily disable them for testing.

6. **Try a Different Terminal or Shell**:
   - Sometimes, the terminal or shell environment might not reflect the latest group changes. Try opening a new terminal or using a different shell.

7. **Reboot the System**:
   - As a last resort, rebooting the system can sometimes resolve lingering permission issues.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, there might be a deeper configuration problem with your Docker setup or system permissions. In such cases, reviewing system logs or Docker logs might provide more insight into the problem.
